Predictive Maintenance API for Manufacturing Equipment
This project is an end-to-end machine learning application that predicts the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of manufacturing equipment based on sensor data. It includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and a Flask API for serving live predictions.

Tech Stack
Python

Pandas for data manipulation

Scikit-learn for machine learning modeling

Flask for the prediction API

Git & GitHub for version control

Live Application üåê
This project is fully deployed and accessible on the internet.

Live Dashboard
You can interact with the live dashboard to see predictions and monitor your equipment.

Dashboard URL: https://dashboardpy-bdkmgpcutfzngcqpljwksp.streamlit.app/

Backend API
The backend API is deployed on Google Cloud Run and serves the predictions for the dashboard.
