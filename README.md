Predictive Maintenance API for Manufacturing Equipment
This project is an end-to-end machine learning application that predicts the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of manufacturing equipment based on sensor data. It includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and a Flask API for serving live predictions.

Tech Stack
Python

Pandas for data manipulation

Scikit-learn for machine learning modeling

Flask for the prediction API

Streamlit for the interactive dashboard

Gunicorn for the production API server

Render for cloud deployment

Git & GitHub for version control
